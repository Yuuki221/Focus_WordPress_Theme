					<h3>Fellowship of Orthodox Christians United to Serve (FOCUS)</h3>
				<p>
					FOCUS North America is a national movement of Orthodox Christians, united in faith and joined by a desire to provide action-oriented and sustainable solutions to poverty in communities across America—offering job training and placement, housing, and feeding programs, as well as other human services to the homeless and working poor of America. FOCUS also plays a vital role in bringing Orthodox Christians into direct relationship with the poor, positively impacting their own lives while helping those in need. In the past four years, FOCUS has grown into a vibrant and strong organization with eight flagship FOCUS Centers across the country and a dedicated volunteer corps of more than 6,000 people, with service outreach programs planned for 29 cities. FOCUS Pittsburgh’s offices are located on Centre Avenue in the Hill District. For more information about our national organization visit :
